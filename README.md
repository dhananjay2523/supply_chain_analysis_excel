Supply Chain Analytics Project
Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a simulated supply chain dataset. The goal was to demonstrate a foundational understanding of data analysis techniques in a business context, focusing on key areas such as inventory management, supplier performance, and logistics.

Key Questions & Objectives
The analysis was structured to answer several key business questions:

Which product types are the most profitable and which have the highest sales volume?

How do supplier costs and manufacturing lead times compare across different suppliers?

What are the most and least efficient shipping methods and routes based on cost and time?

How can we use historical sales data to build a simple predictive model for inventory planning?

What is the relationship between product inspection results and average defect rates?

Methodology
The entire analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Key features and techniques utilized include:

Data Preparation: Initial data cleaning and formatting the dataset as an Excel table.

PivotTables: Used for data aggregation to summarize sales, costs, and defect rates by product, supplier, and transportation mode.

Formulas: Built a simple mathematical model using custom formulas to calculate a reorder point for inventory, including a buffer for safety stock.

Data Visualization: Created charts (bar, column, and pie charts) to visualize key insights on a single dashboard.

Key Insights
Product Performance: Discovered which products were driving the most revenue and had the highest unit sales.

Supplier Analysis: Identified suppliers with the lowest average manufacturing costs and shortest lead times.

Logistics Efficiency: Uncovered the average cost and time associated with different transportation modes and shipping carriers.

Predictive Model: Developed a reorder point model to enable a more proactive approach to inventory management.

Quality Control: Found a clear correlation between inspection results and average defect rates, highlighting potential areas for quality improvement.
